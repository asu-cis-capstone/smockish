###Website User Behavior: ![Google](http://www.google.com/images/logos/google_logo_41.png) Analytics

This is a feature/user story proposal for implementing Google Analytics into the Smockish website. For a start-up business, having metrics that can quickly gauge user trends is crucial to top management. The wealth of analytics provided by Google is invaluable for driving user growth and retention. The Google Analytics platform offers customizable dashboards to present the websiteâ€™s data in a digestible format for decision-making. The tools are free until the site reaches ten million page hits per month per property, where the software may be upgraded to the premium edition. The processing latency for the data is 24-48 hours. Standard accounts that send more than 200,000 sessions per day to Google Analytics will result in the reports being refreshed only once a day. This can delay updates to reports and metrics for up to two days. Listed below is a sample of the real-time tools that are offered:

1. Traffic Analytics
  * Number of unique users
  * User Location
  
2. Site Design Analytics
  * Usability Metrics
  * test3
  
3. User Behavior Analytics
  * test
  * test1
	
The feature is implemented by creating a Google Analytics account, copying and pasting the tracking code snippet into the head tag of every webpage for the site. Since this is a start-up website the team is building from the ground up, no re-design or architecture changes are required. One to two developers can implement this feature and provide ongoing maintenance, with an estimated 20-25 hour time investment. The biggest resource needed is time to learn the base functionality of all of the tools and be able to customize the analytics when needed. The four platform API components to become familiar with are collection, configuration, and reporting. Attached below is an image of an example dashboard and the business value it can generate:
